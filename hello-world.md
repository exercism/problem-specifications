# Hello, World!

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is the traditional first program for beginning programmers. As programmers mature, they eventually want to test their code.

Here at Exercism we encourage [Test Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD). Test Driven Development is where you write your tests before writing any functionality. This allows you to consider the requirements of the code, and any edge cases that you may need to support.

Once you finish writing a test, you write the functionality to make it pass. When all the functionality is finished, you can write tests for your next feature. One of the best features of tests is that they become a safety net when making changes to the existing codebase.

We encourage users to use TDD when solving problems to help form good coding habits,
and help simulate working on **Real Worldâ„¢** projects.

## A typical TDD workflow on Exercism:

1. Run the test file and pick one test that's failing.
2. Write some code to fix the test you picked.
3. Re-run the tests to confirm the test is now passing.
4. Repeat from step 1.
5. [Submit your solution](http://help.exercism.io/submitting-exercises.html).

## Instructions

Submissions are encouraged to be general, within reason. Having said that, it's also important not to over-engineer a solution.

It's important to remember that the goal is to make code as expressive and readable as we can. However, solutions to the hello-world exercise will be not be reviewed by a person, but by rikki- the robot, who will offer an encouraging word. 

## Specification

The `Hello World!` program will greet me, the caller.

If I tell the program my name is Alice, it will greet me by saying "Hello, Alice!".

If I neglect to give it my name, it will greet me by saying "Hello, world!"

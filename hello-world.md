# Hello, World!

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is typically the first 
program that anyone writes in any language. It is, by design, an example of the absolute simplest 
program that can possibly be written in any given language. Whenever an experienced programmer 
starts to learn a new programming language, it is very common that the first program they will 
write is some form of "Hello, World!" This helps them do two things:

1. Verify that their developement environment is working properly
2. Prove to themselves that they can write a very simple program

Basically, a "Hello, World!" program simply outputs the text "Hello, World!" to the screen 
or console. (NOTE: if you don't know what a console aka command-line interface aka command 
window aka terminal window is, you should take a few minutes to 
[read the Wikipedia article about the Command-line interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).)

### Chat

There are a couple places where people hang out and chat:

* [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/exercism/support)
* IRC on [freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/) - in the `#exercism` channel.

### GitHub Issues

If you run into any problems or just have a question, you are always welcome
to [file an issue](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/issues/new) on GitHub.

### StackOverflow

If you're stuck on solving one of the exercises, then your best bet is
to ask a question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), and tag it
with the name of the language.

# Instructions

Correctly determine the fewest number of coins to be given to a customer such that the sum of the coins' value would equal the correct amount of change.

## Examples

- An amount of 15 with available coin values [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one coin of value 5 and one coin of value 10, or [5, 10].
- An amount of 40 with available coin values [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one coin of value 5, one coin of value 10, and one coin of value 25, or [5, 10, 25].

## Edge cases

- Does your algorithm work for any given set of coins?
- Can you ask for negative change?
- Can you ask for a change value smaller than the smallest coin value?

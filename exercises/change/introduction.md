# Introduction

In the mystical village of Coinholt, you stand behind the counter of your bakery, arranging a fresh batch of pastries.
The door creaks open, and in walks Denara, a skilled merchant with a keen eye for quality goods.
After a quick meal, she slides a shimmering golden coin across the counter, worth 100 coins.

You smile, taking the coin, and glance at the total on your ledger: 88 coins.
That means you need to return 12 coins in change.

Denara holds out her hand expectantly.
"Just give me the fewest coins," she says with a smile.
"My pouch is already full, and I don't want to risk losing them on the road."

You know you have a few options.
"We have Lumis (worth 10 coins), Viras (worth 5 coins), and Zenth (worth 2 coins) available for change."

You quickly calculate the possibilities in your head:

- one Lumis (10) + one Zenth (2) = 2 coins total
- two Viras (2 × 5) + one Zenth (2) = 3 coins total
- six Zenth (2 × 6) = 6 coins total

"The best choice is two coins: one Lumis and one Zenth," you say, handing her the change.

Denara smiles, clearly impressed.
"As always, you've got it right."

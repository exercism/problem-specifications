Calculate the Levenshtein distance between two strings.

Lets assume you have three single-character edits (insertion, deletion and
substitution). The Levenshtein distance is then described by the minimum number
of operations needed to convert one input string into another input string. 

For example the distance to get from "mine" to "times" would be 3
(2 substitutions plus 1 insertion).

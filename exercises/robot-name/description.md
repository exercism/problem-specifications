When robots come off the factory floor, they have no name.

The first time you boot them up, a random name is generated in the format
of two uppercase letters followed by three digits, such as RX837 or BC811.

Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings,
which means that their name gets wiped. The next time you ask, it will
respond with a new random name.

The names must be random: they should not follow a predictable sequence.
Random names means a risk of collisions. Your solution should not allow
the use of the same name twice when avoidable. 

## Extensions
- Ensure that the same name is never used twice.
- There are 26^2 * 1,000 = 676,000 possible robot names - ensure that none are repeated.

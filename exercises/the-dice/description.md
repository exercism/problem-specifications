Let's play dice! 

The traditional die is a cube. Each of its six faces shows a different number of dots from 1 to 6. 
Dice are used to produce results from 1 through 6. When a dice is thrown (or rolled) and the dice comes to rest, 
the face of the dice that is uppermost provides the value of the throw. If an unbiased dice is thrown, each value from 1 to 6 is equally likely.

Your programming task is related to the analysis of sequences produced by rolling a dice.
Create a program named Dice to solve the following exercise. The input of the program, a so-called trial, 
contains exactly N characters, each character is a digit from 1 to 6.

How many times did it occur in the trial, that exactly two 6s were rolled after each other? 

For example, in sequence 5`66`111`666`2`66`3441`6` it occurred twice, that exactly two 6s were thrown after each other.

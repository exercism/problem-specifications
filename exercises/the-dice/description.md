Let's play dice! 

The traditional dice is a cube. Each of its six faces shows a different number of dots from 1 to 6. 

Your programming task is related to the analysis of sequences produced by rolling a dice.
Create a program named Dice to solve the following exercise. The input of the program, a so-called trial, 
contains an array of digits, each digit being from 1 to 6.

How many times did it occur in the trial, that exactly two 6s were rolled after each other? 

For example, in sequence 5`66`111`666`2`66`3441`6` it occurred twice, that exactly two 6s were thrown after each other.

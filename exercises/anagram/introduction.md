# Introduction

At a garage sale, you find a lovely vintage typewriter at a bargain price!
Excitedly, you rush home, insert a sheet of paper, and start typing away.
However, your excitement wanes when you examine the output: all words are garbled!
For example, it prints "liar" instead of "rail" and "pots" instead of "stop."
Carefully, you try again, but the result is the same.
Apparently, all keys are wired incorrectly; for instance, the "r" key outputs an "l" and vice versa.
You now understand why they sold it for so little money!

You realize you can use this quirk to generate anagrams: words formed by rearranging the letters of another word.
Pleased with your finding, you spend the rest of the day generating hundreds of anagrams.

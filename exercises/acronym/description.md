# Description

Convert a phrase to its acronym.

Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!

For example:

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|As Soon As Possible|ASAP|
|Liquid-crystal display|LCD|

Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).

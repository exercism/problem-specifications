# Instructions

Your task is to implement bank accounts supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits of money.

As bank accounts can be accessed in many different ways (internet, mobile phones, automatic charges), make sure that your bank accounts can safely be accessed from multiple threads/processes (terminology depends on your programming language) in parallel.

It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must fail.

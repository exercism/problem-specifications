# Introduction

You've been hired to develop **Noble Knots**, the hottest new dating app for nobility!
With centuries of royal intermarriage, things have gotten… _complicated_.
To avoid any _oops-we're-twins_ situations, your job is to build a system that checks how closely two people are related.  

Inspired by Iceland’s famous "[Islendinga-App][islendiga-app]" (which prevents accidental dating of a close relative), your algorithm will determine the **degree of separation** between two individuals in the royal family tree.  

Will your app help crown a perfect match?

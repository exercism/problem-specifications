# Description

Given a limit and a list of factors, find the sum of all unique multiples of the factors that are less than the limit.
All inputs will be greater than or equal to zero.

## Example

If we list all the natural numbers below 20 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18.

The sum of these multiples is 78.

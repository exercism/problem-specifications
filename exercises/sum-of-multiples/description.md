Given a number, find the sum of all the multiples of particular numbers up to
but not including that number.

If we list all the natural numbers up to but not including 20 that are
multiples of either 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18.

The sum of these multiples is 78.

PS: Notice that multiples of both 3 and 5 like for example 15 will counted only once.

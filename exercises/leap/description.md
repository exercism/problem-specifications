# Description

A leap year (in the Gregorian calendar) occurs in every year that is evenly divisible by 4,  except if the year is evenly divisible by 100, unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400.

Some examples:
- 1997 was not a leap year as it's not divisible by 4.
- 1900 was not a leap year as it's not divisible by 400
- 2000 was a leap year!

Your job is to determine if any given year is a leap year.

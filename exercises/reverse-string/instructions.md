# Instructions

Your task is to reverse a given string.

Some examples:
- Turn `"stressed"` into `"desserts"`.
- Turn `"strops"` into `"sports"`.
- Turn `"racecar"` into `"racecar"`.

Many languages provide built-in functions or methods for reversing strings, but for this exercise, presume you have to write it from scratch.

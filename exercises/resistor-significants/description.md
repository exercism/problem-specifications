Resistors have color coded bands that encode their value in Ohms. The bands have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number. The first 2 bands represent the significant figures of a resistor's value in Ohms. 
[Significant figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures) or significant digits is a concept used in measurements to indicate the numbers without trailing zero's.

The band colors are encoded as follows:

- Black: 0
- Brown: 1
- Red: 2
- Orange: 3
- Yellow: 4
- Green: 5
- Blue: 6
- Violet: 7
- Grey: 8
- White: 9

Combining the numbers of the first two bands gives one the significant figures of its value in Ohms. As an example, if the first band is blue (6) and the second band is grey (8), the combined significant figures' value is the number 68.

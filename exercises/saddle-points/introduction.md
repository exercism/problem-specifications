# Introduction

You plan to build a tree house in the woods near your house so that you can watch the sun rise and set.

You've obtained data from a local survey company that show the heights of all the trees in each rectangular section of the map.
You need to analyze each grid on the map to find good trees for your tree house.

A good tree will be the tallest tree compared to all the other trees to the east and west, so that you have the best possible view of the sunrises and sunsets.
You don't like climbing too much, so a good tree will also be the shortest among all the trees to the north and to the south.

# Description

Your goal is to create a diamond shape using letters and spaces.

You're given a letter, which represents the widest point of the diamond.

Let's look at some examples.

Diamond for letter 'A':

```text
A
```

Diamond for letter 'C':

```text
  A  
 B B 
C   C
 B B 
  A  
```

Diamond for letter 'E':

```text
    A    
   B B   
  C   C  
 D     D 
E       E
 D     D 
  C   C  
   B B   
    A    
```

## Requirements

These are the full requirements:
- The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).
- The letters form a diamond shape.
- The top half has the letters in ascending order.
- The bottom half has the letters in descending order.
- All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.
- The first row contains one 'A'.
- The last row contains one 'A'.
- All rows have as many trailing spaces as leading spaces (this might be 0 spaces).
- The diamond is horizontally symmetric.
- The diamond is vertically symmetric.
- The four corners (containing the spaces) are triangles.

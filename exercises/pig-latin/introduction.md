# Introduction

Your parents have challenged you and your sibling to a game of two-on-two basketball.
Confident they'll win, they let you score the first couple of points, but then they start trying harder.
Needing a little boost, you start speaking in [Pig Latin][pig-latin], which is a made-up children's language that's difficult for non-children to understand.
This gives you the edge to prevail over your parents!

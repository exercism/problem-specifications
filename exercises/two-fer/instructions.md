# Instructions

Your task is to determine what you will say to your friend as you hand them their cookie.

If your friend is named Do-yun, then you will say:

```text
One for Do-yun, one for me.
```

On the other hand, if for some reason you can't remember your friend's name just then, you'll say _you_ instead of their name:

```text
One for you, one for me.
```

Here are some examples:

|Name    |Dialogue
|:-------|:------------------
|Alice   |One for Alice, one for me.
|Bohdan  |One for Bohdan, one for me.
|        |One for you, one for me.
|Zaphod  |One for Zaphod, one for me.

# Introduction

One evening, we found an old notebook filled with scribbles, like someone had been chasing a strange idea.
On one page, there was a single question: **Can every number find its way to 1?**
It was tied to something called the Collatz Conjecture, a puzzle that has baffled thinkers for decades.

The instructions seemed simple.
Pick any positive integer:

* If it's even, divide it by 2.
* If it's odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

Then, repeat these steps with the result, continuing indefinitely.

Curious, we picked number 12 to test, and started the journey:

12 ➜ 6 ➜ 3 ➜ 10 ➜ 5 ➜ 16 ➜ 8 ➜ 4 ➜ 2 ➜ 1

Counting from the second number (6), it took 9 steps to reach 1, and each time the rules repeated, the number kept changing.
At first, the steps seemed unpredictable — jumping up, down, and all over — yet they always ended at 1, no matter the starting number.

It was fascinating, but also puzzling.
Why does this always seem to work?
Could there be a number where the process breaks down, looping forever or escaping into infinity?
No one knows for sure.

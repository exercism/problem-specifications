You and your fellow cohort of those in the "know" when it comes to
binary decide to come up with a secret "handshake".

```
1 = wink
10 = double blink
100 = close your eyes
1000 = jump


10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake.
```

Here's a couple of examples:

Given the input 9, the function would return the array
["wink", "jump"]

Given the input "11001", the function would return the array
["jump", "wink"]


The program should consider strings specifying an invalid binary as the
value 0.

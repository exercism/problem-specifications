# Introduction

The dice game [Yacht][yacht] is from the same family as Poker Dice, Generala and particularly Yahtzee, of which it is a precursor.
In the game, five dice are rolled and the result can be entered in any of twelve categories.
The score of a throw of the dice depends on the category chosen.

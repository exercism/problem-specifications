# Description

Count the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation.

Parallelism is about doing things in parallel that can also be done
sequentially. A common example is counting the frequency of letters.
Create a function that returns the total frequency of each letter in a
list of texts and that employs parallelism.

Uppercase letters count towards their lowercase equivalent.  Support
at least the extended Latin character set, so that unicode "Ã¼" is
counted separately from "u".  Punctuation and whitespace are ignored.

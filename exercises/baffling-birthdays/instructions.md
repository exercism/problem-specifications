# Instructions

Your task is to implement a solution that verifies the Birthday Problem's probabilities.

To do this, you need to:

- Determine if two birthdates match (same month and day).
- Generate random birthdates.
- Check if a set of randomly generated birthdates contains at least one matching pair.
- Calculate the probability of at least one match for different group sizes.

~~~~exercism/caution
The Birthday Problem assumes that birthdays are uniformly distributed within a single year.
While the year should vary between different random birthdate generation calls, all birthdates within a single call must share the same year.

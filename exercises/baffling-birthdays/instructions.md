# Instructions

Your task is to estimate the birthday paradox's probabilities.

To do this, you need to:

- Determine if two birthdates have the same month and day.
- Generate random birthdates.
- Check if a collection of randomly generated birthdates contains at least one matching pair.
- Estimate the probability of at least one match for different group sizes.

~~~~exercism/caution
The birthday paradox assumes that:

- There are 365 possible birthdays (no leap years).
- Each birthday is equally likely (uniform distribution).

Your implementation must follow these assumptions.

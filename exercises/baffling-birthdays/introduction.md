# Introduction

Fresh out of graduation, you're throwing a huge party to celebrate with friends and family.
Over 70 people have shown up, including your mildly eccentric Uncle Ted.

In one of his usual antics, he bets you £100 that at least two people in the room share the same birthday.
That sounds ridiculous — there are 365 possible birthdays, so you confidently accept.

To your astonishment, after collecting just 32 birthdays, you've already found a match.
Accepting your loss, you hand Uncle Ted his £100, but something feels off.

The next day, curiosity gets the better of you.
A quick web search leads you to the [Birthday Paradox][birthday-problem], which reveals that with just 23 people, the probability of a shared birthday exceeds 50%.

Ah. So _that's_ why Uncle Ted was so confident.

Determined to turn the tables, you start looking up other paradoxes; next time, _you'll_ be the one making the bets.

The Birthday Paradox is a [veridical paradox][veridical-paradox]: even though it feels wrong, it is actually true.

# Introduction

After weeks filled with eager anticipation, the day has finally arrived for you and your friends to embark on your inaugural adventure in [Dungeons & Dragons][dnd] (D&D).
As newcomers to the realm of fantasy and role-playing, the first step for each of you is to breathe life into your characters by crafting their identities.
The fate of these characters hinges on the whims of 6-sided dice.
Yet, in a sudden twist of fate, you're met with puzzled looksâ€”everyone's eyes are on you, expecting you to unveil the dice.
The realization hits you like a bolt from the blue: the responsibility of providing the dice was yours, sparked by your enthusiasm for D&D.
Your heart sinks as the oversight dawns on you, threatening to unravel the day's plans.
However, not all is lost.
Armed with a rudimentary knowledge of coding, a spark of ingenuity flickers to life.
You decide to forge a digital alternative: a program to simulate the dice rolls, salvaging your D&D adventure from the jaws of cancellation.

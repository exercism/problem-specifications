# Introduction

After months of careful planning, the expedition Bob works for is about to leave.
As he is a sherpa, he will be paid the value he carried to the base camp.

In front of him are many items, each with a value and weight.
Bob would gladly take all of the items, but his knapsack can only hold so much weight.
Bob has to carefully consider which items to take so that the total value of his selection is maximized.

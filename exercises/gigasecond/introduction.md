# Introduction

The way we measure time is kind of messy.
We have 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour.
This comes from ancient Babylon, where they used 60 as the basis for their number system.
We have 24 hours in a day, 7 days in a week, and months?
Well, for months it depends not only on which month it is, but also what calendar is used in the country you live in.

If we ever colonize Mars or some other planet, it's going to get even messier.
If someone says "year" do they mean Earth-year or Mars-year?

Instead, we could use the metric system, and count everything in seconds.

- A food recipe might explain that you need to let the brownies cook in the oven for two kiloseconds (that's two thousand seconds).
- Perhaps you and your family would travel to somewhere exotic for two megaseconds (that's two million seconds).
- And if you and your spouse were married for _a thousand million_ seconds, you would celebrate your one gigasecond anniversary.

The author Vernor Vinge uses the metric system as the basis for time measurements in his science fiction novel, "A Deepness in the Sky".

The program should raise an error if the triangle cannot exist.

## Hint

In mathematics, a degenerate case is a limiting case in which an element of a
class of objects is qualitatively different from the rest of the class and hence
belongs to another, usually simpler, class.

1. If the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is equal to the
   length of the third side, there exists a degenerate triangle.

2. The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle always exceeds or is
   equal to the length of the third side, a principle known as the _triangle
   inequality_.

Therefore, a degenerate triangle does not violate the principle of _triangle
inequality_.

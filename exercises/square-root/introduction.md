# Introduction

We are launching a deep space exploration rocket and we need a way to make sure the navigation system stays on target.

The first step in our coordinate calculation involves taking a number as input and finding another number which multiplied by itself will equal our input number, or in other words, finding the square root of our input number.

Because the journey will be very long, we had to make our rocket’s onboard computer very power efficient so it wouldn’t drain the batteries.
Unfortunately that means that we can’t rely on fancy math libraries and functions, as they use more power.
Instead we want to calculate or approximate the square root directly.

Given a natural radicand, return its square root.

Check out the Wikipedia pages on [square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root) and [methods of computing square roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots).

Recall that natural numbers are positive real whole numbers (i.e. 1, 2, 3 and up).

When implementing this in a language with a built-in square root function, implement your own function.

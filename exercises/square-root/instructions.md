# Instructions

Your task is to calculate the square root of a given number.

- Try to avoid using the pre-existing math libraries of your language.
- As input you’ll be given a positive whole number, i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4…
- You also only need to return a positive whole number.

Some potential approaches:

- Linear or binary search for a number that gives the input number when squared.
- Successive approximation using Newton's or Heron's method.
- Calculating one digit at a time or one bit at a time.

Most people inherit not only their socioeconomic class from their parents, but also DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), a set of chemical instructions that influence how their bodies are constructed!
DNA is a long chain of other chemicals and the most important are the four nucleotides, Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine and Thymine. A single DNA chemical can contain billions of these four nucleotides and the order in which they occur is important!
We call the order of these nucleotides in a bit of DNA a "DNA sequence".

We represent a DNA sequence as an ordered collection of these four nucleotides and a common way to do that is with a string of characters such as "ATTACA" for a DNA sequence of 6 nucleotides.

Given a string representing a DNA sequence, count how many of each nucleotide is present.
If the string contains characters that aren't A, C, G, or T then it is invalid and you should throw an error.

For example:

```
"GATTACA" -> 'G': 1, 'A': 3, 'T': 2, 'C': 1
"INVALID" -> error
```

Given a society that determines life outcomes by inheritance, [rebel](https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/).

You do not need to understand anything about nucleotides or DNA to complete this exercise.

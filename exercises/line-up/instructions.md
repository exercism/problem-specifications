# Instructions

Given a name and a number, your task is to produce a sentence with an [ordinal numeral][ordinal-numeral] to print onto the ticket.
Yaʻqūb expects to use numbers from 1 up to 999.

Rules:

- Numbers ending in 1 (except for 11) → `st`
- Numbers ending in 2 (except for 12) → `nd`
- Numbers ending in 3 (except for 13) → `rd`
- All other numbers → `th`

Examples:

- `'Mary', 1` → `'Mary, you are the 1st customer we serve today. Thank you!'`
- `'John', 12` → `'John, you are the 12th customer we serve today. Thank you!'`
- `'Dahir', 162` → `'Dahir, you are the 162nd customer we serve today. Thank you!'`

# Introduction

Your friend Yaʻqūb works the counter at a deli in town, slicing, weighing, and wrapping orders for a line of hungry customers that gets longer every day.
He sees that waiting customers start to loose track of who is next, so he wants to have numbered tickets for them to pick when they arrive.

He is a nice person, and so he does not want to have only a number on the ticket. They shall get a proper English sentence with their name and number in it.

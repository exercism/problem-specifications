The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure list without using any  method that do this for you automatically.

For Example

input: [0, 2, [[2, 3], 8, 100, 4, [[50]]], -2]

output: [0, 2, 2, 3, 8, 100, 4, 50, -2]

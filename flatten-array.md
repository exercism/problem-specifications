The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any null/nill values.

For example:

input: [1,[2,3,null,4],[null],5]

output: [1,2,3,4,5]

## Note

Implement the function yourself. Do not use something else to perform the flattening for you.

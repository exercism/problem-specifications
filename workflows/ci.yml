# This workflow will do a clean install of the dependencies and run tests across different versions
#
# Replace <track> with the track name
# Replace <image-name> with an image to run the jobs on
# Replace <action to setup tooling> with a github action to setup tooling on the image
# Replace <install dependencies> with a cli command to install the dependencies
# Replace <code-extensions> with file extensions that should trigger the workflow
#
# Find Github Actions to setup tooling here:

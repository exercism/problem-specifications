# Workflow templates

The content in this folder doesn't _necessarily_ belong in this repository, but we don't have a great place to put it that allows for good discoverability. The GitHub Actions workflows in this folder can be adapted to work with any CI, because the base structure will remain the same.

Example implementation of these workflow files [can be found in `exercism/javascript`][git-javascript].

## Track CI actions

The recommended actions are as follows:

1. [`configlet` linting][git-configlet] in order to check `config.json`
2. check for stubs
3. check for documentation (`v3` requires new files; this might move to `configlet`)
4. lint the exercises using a "maintainers" configuration
5. test the exercises using the example/examplar files (can include build step)

There can be track-specific actions, for example:

1. check the [integrity][wiki-integrity] of the exercise configurations
2. check the formatting of the exercise files

And perhaps you'd want more Quality Of Life checks, such as:

1. ensure CONTRIBUTING exists
2. ensure there is a sane lockfile for dependencies
3. ensure links inside markdown files are valid
4. ...

## Recommendations

For each action think about how often it should run.

- The `configlet` linting is something that's so important (because a track can break if the `config.json` breaks), that it probably should run, always, **but** only needs to run once per commit.
- The existence or integrity of files only needs to run once per commit.
- If a track is supposed to run under multiple runtime-versions or compiler-versions, building/testing exercises should be ran against each supported version
- PRs _probably_ only need to run actions on files _added_ or _changed_, but since a file can influence an exercise, it's safer to run the actions for the _exercise_, if one of its files changes.

It can be very helpful to make the actions that should run, available locally as well. This means that the scripts that do the actual work are also manually runnable. **Do not inline** the action inside the workflow files. For example, checking for stubs can be completely bashed out inside the workflow file, but the recommendation here is to create a new executable script `scripts/ci-check` instead.

If the track has a single "top-level" dependency file and/or other configuration files, add an integrity step (to exist alongside a `scripts/sync` or `bin/sync`) that ensures the top-level/base files are the same as the one copied to the exercise directories. Now dependencies can be updates, synced across the repository, and ensures that all exercises have the same configuration.

If the track uses additional workflows that require access to the GitHub token or other secrets, it's best practice to pin **all** actions used in the workflow to a specific commit. See [GitHub's security hardening guide][github-actions-security] for details. For example, instead of `uses: julia-actions/setup-julia@v1`, use `uses: julia-actions/setup-julia@d26d1111976eae5f00db04f0515ab744ec9cd79e # 1.3.1`.

## Templates

In this directory at minimum there are the following templates:

- `configlet.yml`: This workflow will do a fetch the latest configlet binary and lint this repository. Run on every commit. For PRs, runs on the actual commit and a "after merge" tree.
- `ci.yml`: This workflow **only runs on `master`**, once on each commit.
  1. Run a 'pre-check' command (check for stubs, lint, docs, etc.) for all exercises
  2. Run a 'ci' command (build and test) for multiple versions, for all exercises
- `pr.ci.yml`: This workflow **only runs on PRs**, once on each commit.
  1. Run a 'pre-check' command (check for stubs, lint, docs, etc.) for changed files
  2. Run a 'ci' command (build and test) for multiple versions, for changed exercises

The non-pr workflows can also be triggered via [`workflow_dispatch`][github-workflow-dispatch].

Each file has listed at the top which "scripts" should be available. If you want these to be binaries, replace `scripts/xxx` with `bin/xxx`. Some tooling will _require_ binaries to be inside a `bin` folder.

- `scripts/ci`: a script that should build and test all exercises using the example solutions against the tests
- `scripts/ci-check`: a script that should lint all exercises, and optionally check for stubs, configuration integrity, and more
- `scripts/pr`: same as `scripts/ci`, but should only run exercises resolved from the paths given as input
- `scripts/pr-check`: same as `scripts/ci-check`, but should only run for files or exercises resolved from the paths given as input

## Troubleshooting

> **Changed a top-level file that should trigger a CI run on all exercises**

At moment of writing, `pr.ci.yml` only allows for "extension" testing. Ideally this is updated to trigger always when certain files are changed (for example the binary to run the tests). However, these changes are often infrequent and done by maintainers, that the fact that `ci.yml` runs on master, always, for everything, is probably safe enough.

> **Created a scripts/xxx file on Windows and now it doesn't work on {other OS}**

By default, files created on Windows don't have metadata in the [git-index][git-index] embedded about their executability, because the model for permissions on windows is different. Git, by default, will use the git-index metadata to determine if the file should be executable on POSIX-based systems, and thus make the `scripts/xxx` file NOT executable.

```bash
git update-index --chmod=+x scripts/xxx
git commit -m "Make scripts/xxx executable"
```

# Exercism's Style Guide

This document acts as a Style Guide for the language and wording used in exercises.

## Consistency

### Consistency within an exercise.

There are some terms that have multiple valid spellings (e.g. "lower case" vs "lowercase"). 
Where a consistent style has not been agreed within this document, these must be consistent within an exercise.

## Language

All content should be written in US English. In the future other translations may occur, but the "official" Exercism language is US English.

### Measurements
All units of measurement must be [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) or [SI-derived](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_derived_unit) units.

## Abbreviations, acronyms and initialisms
> All abbreviations, acronyms and initialisms should be defined. 
> - If the unabbreviated term is clear, always include the full wording at first use (e.g. "Domain-specific language (DSL)");
> - If the term needs more explaination to be clear to someone unfamiliar, explain it: (e.g. "The four basic types of SQL commands are Create, Read, Update, Delete. The initials of these come together to form the word CRUD.");
> - If explaining the acryonm adds no tangible value to the student, simply introduce the acryonm as if it were a "proper noun" (e.g. "People's inherit DNA, a set of chemical instructions that influence how their bodies are constructed")

## Choice of words

### Mathematical and esoteric terms.

In any place that mathematical terms are used they should be explained or substituted out for terms that require less domain knowledge.

Examples:
- Rather than using "natural numbers", we should use "positive whole numbers".
- If we want to use the phrase "rational numbers", it must be explained in the introduction to the exercise.
- Rather than using the word range (which can have different meanings in different contexts) use "x < ? < y (greater than x and less than y)".
- Rather than using "esoteric terms", use the phrase "terms not understood by the majority of people".

## Use consistency within an exercise.

There are some terms that have multiple valid spellings (e.g. "lower case" vs "lowercase"). 
Where a consistent style has not been agreed within this document, these must be consistent within an exercise.

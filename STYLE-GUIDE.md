# Exercism's Style Guide

This document acts as a Style Guide for the language and wording used in exercises.

## General principle

All content should be written in US English.
All units of measurement must be [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) or [SI-derived](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_derived_unit) units.
In the future other translations may occur, but the "official" Exercism language is US English.

## Explain or substitute mathematical and esoteric terms.

In any place that mathematical terms are used they should be explained or substituted out for terms that require less domain knowledge.

Examples:
- Rather than using "natural numbers", we should use "positive whole numbers".
- If we want to use the phrase "rational numbers", it must be explained in the introduction to the exercise.
- Rather than using the word range (which can have different meanings in different contexts) use "greater than x and less than y".

## Use consistency within an exercise.

There are some terms that have multiple valid spellings (e.g. "lower case" vs "lowercase"). 
Where a consistent style has not been agreed within this document, these must be consistent within an exercise.

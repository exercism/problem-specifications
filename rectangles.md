Create a program to count the rectangles in an ASCII diagram like the one below.

```
   +--+
   |  |
+--+--+
|  |  |
+--+--+
```

The above diagram contains 5 rectangles:

```


+-----+
|     |
+-----+
```

```
   +--+
   |  |
   |  |
   |  |
   +--+
```

```
   +--+
   |  |
   +--+


```

```
       
       
   +--+
   |  |
   +--+
```

```
       
       
+--+
|  |
+--+
```

You may assume that the input is always a proper rectangle (i.e. the length of
every line equals the length of the first line).

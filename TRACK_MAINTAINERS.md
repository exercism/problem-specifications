https://github.com/exercism/discussions/issues/97 investigated the status of all Exercism language tracks. This file is intended to continue and maintain that process in a community driven manner.

Information about who is a maintainer can be found on the [Exercism Teams
page](https://github.com/orgs/exercism/teams) but unhelpfully, you need to be a
team member before you can see the other team members.

Ideally a bot could keep this file updated, but until someone writes one we
will just have to do it manually.
